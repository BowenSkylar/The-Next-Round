# The-Next-Round
General Assembly Project 2 - The Next Round CRUD application, beer search &amp; save


## Motivation

My motivation behind this project was the feeling you have while staring at the countless beers on the chalkboard walls at any given bar,
pondering the thought of what are all of these beers? IPA's? Craft Beers? Ciders? The possibilites are almost endless. 



## What is The Next Round
This is a web app that will allow users to search for their favorite beer, or maybe even a beer they are interested in trying. Your search will present you with some specs of each beer; the beer name, recieveing results such as a short description, the alcohol by volume, if its organic or not, and food pairings if available for each beer. You can then add these beers to your "tab" where you can then keep track of your beers.

## API Reference

brewerydb.com

## Interaction
User will create a username and password saved into a MongoDB, and then log in where you are presented with a search page, you can access your tab/favorites from this page or from the start search and add beers of your choice.

## Issues as of now
- [] Cannot deploy on roku
- [] Could not configure users to properly render their saved beers
- [] Specific beers need to be used to access API correctly (ex: (not corona) must be corona light)

#Some Example Search Terms
- Stella Artois
- Bitter
- Harvest Pumpkin Ale
- Blueberry
- Belgian White Ale

## Things I would like to improve
I would love to fix several bugs through this appliation, finish styling as planned, and fix user displays for favorites with delete options working correctly. Also correctly host project on Heroku. ( fix mongo errors )
