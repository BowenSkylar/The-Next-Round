# The-Next-Round
General Assembly Project 2 - The Next Round CRUD application, beer search &amp; save


## What is The Next Round

Objective of app is to search by beer name, recieveing results such as a short description, the alcohol by volume, if its organic or not, 
and food pairings if available.

## Code Example

URL bar: http://localhost:3000/?searchTerm=Corona+Light

## Motivation

My motivation behind this project was the feeling you have while staring at the countless beers on the chalkboard walls at any given bar,
pondering the thought of what are all of these beers? IPA's? Craft Beers? Ciders? The possibilites are almost endless.
